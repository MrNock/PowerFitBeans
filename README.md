***Error message*** in Netbeans when testing the VLC Video Player:
Native library (win32-x86-64/libvlc.dll) not found in resource path

***Path was not correct*** as per the following response, because the VLC was in 'C:\Program Files **(x86)**\VideoLAN', not in 'C:\Program Files\VideoLAN':

***Solved*** I fixed it by uninstalling and re-installing VLC in the correct folder path.
