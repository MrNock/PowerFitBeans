***Everything you should know about 8 point grid system in UX design***
<br>
Website, apps, dashboard, UI, etc. there is a variety of screen sizes. Pixel densities have continued to increase making the work of asset generation more complicated for designers. Utilizing number like 8 to size and space elements makes scaling for a wide variety of devices easy and consistent. Also, the majority of popular screen sizes are divisible by 8 which makes for an easy fit. The principle of 8pt Grid is that use multiples of 8 (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, etc.) to layout, dimensions, padding, and margin of elements.

***The 60–30–10 Rule***
<br>
What is the 60–30–10 Rule?
<br>
The 60–30–10 rule is a popular color theory used by interior designers, fashion designers, and graphic designers to create a balanced and harmonious color scheme. The rule states that a color scheme should consist of three colors in the following proportions:
<br>
* 60% of the dominant color
* 30% of the secondary color
* 10% of the accent color

The dominant color is the main color of the design, and it should be the most prominent and visible color. The secondary color is a complementary color that supports the dominant color and provides visual interest. The accent color is a pop of color that adds a bit of excitement and contrast to the design.
